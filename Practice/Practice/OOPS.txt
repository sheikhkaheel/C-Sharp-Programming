OOPS(Object Oriented Programming)

Its the programming based on object and classes

Class 
 
Its is a refrence / blueprint or the instance of a object
Its does not take memory but after the creation of its object
We can say class is a virual world while as object is based on real entity.

Object

Its collection of data and methods 

Constructer

Its like a method. Its have same name as Class with no return type. Its used for intialisation.

Excess Modifiers / Specifiers 

These are the specifiers which give excess to the class/ data/ method
They are public , private, protected , default
public :- this gives exess (data / methods) to be used within the classes.
private :- this gives excess (data / methods) to be used within the same class.
protected :- this gives excess (data / methods) to be used within the classes which are inherited.
default :- these are added to the package .Package are collection of similiar classes.

Inheritence

Its a concept in which a class (derived / sub/ child class) inherits the properties of another class (base /super/ parent class)

Single Inheritence occurs within two classes and the patterns through single inheritences with many classes gives rise to the differnt types of inheritence 
like multilevel, multiple, hiararchical and hybrid inheritence

Polymorphism

Its has two types compile time and run time polymorphism
Compile time polymorphism is called method overloading 
Method Overloading has two important things i.e functionName and type/no of parameters
Run time polymorphism is called method overwriting 
Method Overwriting has 4 important things i.e excessSpecifier ,return type ,methodName ,parameters.
